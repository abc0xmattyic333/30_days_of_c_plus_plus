/*

Often in our examples, we simplify variable names to match their data type (myInt or myNum for int types, myChar for char types, etc.). 
In real life, we should use more descriptive names for our variables. 
This makes our code easier to read and understand.

// Software Engineer data

int engineerAge = 32;
float engineerSalary = 100000.00;
char engineerGender = 'M';
bool engineerIsEmployed = true;

// Print variables

cout << "Engineer Age: " << engineerAge << endl;
cout << "Engineer Salary: " << engineerSalary << endl;
cout << "Engineer Gender: " << engineerGender << endl;

// Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

// In this real-life example, we calculate the area of a rectangle using the length and width variables.

int length = 10;
int width = 5;
int area;

// Calculate the area of the rectangle

area = length * width;

// Print the area of the rectangle

cout << "Length is: " << length << endl;
cout << "Width is: " << width << endl;
cout << "Area of the rectangle is: " << area << endl;
