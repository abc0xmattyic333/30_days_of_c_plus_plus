// C++ New Lines

// New Lines

// To insert a new line in C++, you can use the '\n' character. This character is called the newline character. It is used to insert a new line in the output of the program.

// Example

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello! :)\n";
    cout << "Welcome to 30_days_of_c_plus_plus (C++)!!!\n";
    cout << "Author: Matthew Fair (abc0xmattyic333)\n";
    cout << "Github: https://github/abc0xmattyic333\n";
    cout << "Twitter/X: https://x.com/abc0xmattyic333\n";
    cout << "Date: 2024-10-13\n\n";
    cout << "Language: C++" << endl;
    return 0;
}

// You can also use another << operator and place the '\n' character at the end of the string to insert a new line.

// Tip: Two '\n' characters after each other will create a blank line.

// Another way to insert a new line is to use the endl manipulator. The endl manipulator is used to insert a new line in the output of the program.

// Both '\n' and endl are used to insert a new line in the output of the program. However, endl is slower than '\n' because endl flushes the output buffer, while '\n' does not.

// But what is \n exactly? It is a character escape sequence. Character escape sequences are used to represent characters that are not printable or are difficult to represent directly in the code.

// The newline character (\n) is a character escape sequence that represents a new line. It is used to insert a new line in the output of the program.

// Examples of other vaild character escape sequences are:

// \t - tab
// \b - backspace
// \r - carriage return
// \f - form feed
// \v - vertical tab
// \\ - backslash
// \' - single quote
// \" - double quote
// \? - question mark
// \0 - null character
// \a - alert
// \nnn - octal value
// \xhh - hexadecimal value
